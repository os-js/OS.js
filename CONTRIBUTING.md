# Contributing

Follow the guide on https://manual.os-js.org/development/ for how to work with a development environment and a list of repositories to work with.

If you want to contribute, but not sure what to do, here's a list of things that I always need help with:

* Translations
* Bug-hunting
* Finding security problems
* Themes and general graphics
* Website design (like the homepage and manuals)
* Documentation

If you need help, or just up for some general discussion, head into the [community forums](https://community.os-js.org/) or [community chat](https://gitter.im/os-js/OS.js).

You can also donate or become a patreon, which helps out covering server costs and potentially make it possible to put out bounties:

* Donate/tip anonymously with [Gratipay](https://gratipay.com/os-js/)
* Donate via [PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_donations&business=andersevenrud%40gmail%2ecom&lc=NO&currency_code=USD&bn=PP%2dDonationsBF%3abtn_donate_SM%2egif%3aNonHosted)
