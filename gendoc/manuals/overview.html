<h1>OS.js Overview</h1>
<p>
  Here I will try to explain the basics of how OS.js works
</p>

<h2>Server</h2>
<div class="indent">
  <p>
    The server is very simple. It just serves file like a normal web-server would (think Apache).
  </p>
  <p>
    There is also an API for calling functions from the client via XHR. It operates using a simple JSON-based messaging system with HTTP POST requests (or Websockets).
  </p>
  <p>
    You can easily extend this API. Includes support for <i>Node</i> and <i>PHP</i>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Read more about the Server API <a href="/OS.js-v2/doc/server/">here</a>.
  </p>
</div>

<h2>Client</h2>
<div class="indent">
  <p>
    The client is split up into two distribution types. <b>dist</b> and <b>dist-dev</b>. The only difference here is that <b>dist</b> is a production version of OS.js that contains minimized sources for optimal performance.
  </p>
  <p>
    You should use <b>dist-dev</b> if you're testing and/or developing (making changes) to OS.js. This way you don't have to recompile everything every time you do something.
  </p>

  <h3>Initialization process</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Server sends the index.html file</li>
    <li>
      All resources required to boot is loaded
      <ol>
        <li>A session is requested</li>
        <li>The <i>Handler</i> is initialized</li>
        <li>Depending on the <i>Handler</i> login is now taking place</li>
        <li>
          If login was successfull, start a session
          <ol>
            <li>Browser events are bound</li>
            <li>Any extra defined resources are loaded</li>
            <li>All packages are loaded and their manifest is cached</li>
            <li>
              The Window Manager launches
              <ol>
                <li>Themes are loaded</li>
                <li>Settings are restored</li>
                <li>Panels initializes</li>
                <li>IconView and any other extras are loaded</li>
              </ol>
            </li>
            <li>Previous session (if any) is restored</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li><i>Initialization complete</i></li>
  </ol>

  <h3>About the Code</h3>
  <p>
    JavaScript is written in Strict ECMAScript 5.1. No third-party libraries (like jQuery) is used in the base code, only browser internal APIs.
  </p>
  <p>
    Uses <i>prototype</i> patterns for class inheritance. Everything is namespaced and fully linted.
  </p>
  <p>
    All operations (except DOM) are asynchronous. Does not use <i>Promises</i>, but simple callbacks with this pattern:
  </p>
  <pre clas="code">
  asyncOperation(args, function(error, result, ...) {
  });
  </pre>

  <h3>Configuration</h3>
  <p>
    Configuration is done via a JSON-based system in <i>src/conf</i>.
  </p>
  <p>
    These files are loaded in alphabetical order and merged together. They are separated into several categories to make it easier on the end-user.
  </p>

  <h3>Building</h3>
  <p>
    OS.js features a custom build system that is super easy to use. The build tool is called <b>obt</b>.
  </p>
  <p>
    A <i>Makefile</i> is included to make it easy to use. One command to rule them all: <b>make</b>.
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="/OS.js-v2/doc/manuals/man-configuration.html">See here for more information on building</a>
  </p>

  <h3>Packages</h3>
  <p>
    Any <i>Service</i>, <i>Application</i> or <i>Extension</i> in OS.js is called a <b>package</b>.
  </p>
  <p>
    A package consists of a manifest file that describes the package and sources/resources.
  </p>
  <p>
    They can also contain an API script so you can do XHR requests to the server to perform certain operations in the backend.
  </p>
  <p>
    Packages are installable system-wide (not available from client) or can be installed by the user (user packages cannot use XHR because of security reasons).
  </p>

  <h3>The API</h3>
  <p>
    OS.js features a fully loaded API separated by namespaces.
    The entire API is <a href="/OS.js-v2/doc/client/">documented here</a>.
  </p>
  <div class="indent">
    <h4>Core</h4>
    <p>
      The Core API contains all the base Classes and Session methods (login, logout, process launching, etc.).
    </p>
    <h4>Utils</h4>
    <p>
      DOM functions and general usefull functions.
    </p>
    <h4>GUI</h4>
    <p>
      This is where all the GUI Elements are.
    </p>
    <h4>Dialogs</h4>
    <p>
      This is where all the Dialog Classes are.
    </p>
    <h4>Helpers</h4>
    <p>
      Helpers are, you guessed it, here to help you out. These are classes that makes it easier for you to write applications or access external APIs (for example).
    </p>
    <h4>VFS</h4>
    <p>
      The <i>Virtual Filesystem</i> lets you manipulate files on the server or any external services (like GoogleDrive, OneDrive and Dropbox).
    </p>
  </div>

  <h3>Sources</h3>
  <p>
    The filetree itself should be pretty self-explainatory.
  </p>
  <p>
    All JavaScript classes are separated into individual files with the filename matching the classname.
    Files without classes normally contains a collection of functions (like API methods).
  </p>
  <p>
    Stylesheets are also separated into individial files with the filename describing where they are applied.
  </p>
  <p>
    The freferred format for config files, metadata, etc. is <i>JSON</i>.
  </p>

  <h3>Themes</h3>
  <p>
    Themes are separated into these categories: <i>style</i>, <i>icons</i> and <i>fonts</i>. These contains a manifest file just like packages does, but is quite a bit simpler.
  </p>
</div>
