<h1>Managing system packages/applications</h1>

<p>
  To add a repository, simply clone and add the directory name to a list.
</p>

<pre class="code">
git clone --recursive https://github.com/username/package-repository src/packages/package-repository
</pre>

<p>
  Then simply add it to the array in <i>src/packages/repositories.json</i>
</p>

<p>
  If you want to remove a repository, simply delete the directory or remove it from the list
</p>

<!--
<p>
  You can use the built-in tools to add and remove custom packages
</p>
<pre class="code">

# Clone and add to list
./obt repositry clone foobar https://github.com/username/package-repository

# Or if you want to add a custom folder of packages
cp /path/to/packages src/packages/my-repo-name
./obt repositry add my-repo-name

# Clone and add to list
./obt repositry clone foobar https://github.com/username/package-repository

# Or if you want to add a custom folder of packages
cp /path/to/packages src/packages/my-repo-name
./obt repositry add my-repo-name

# Then remove with
./obt repository remove foobar

# Or delete entirely with
./obt repository delete foobar

</pre>
