# OS.js on Docker

You can also use [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) to set up an environment.

You can grab a configuration from the [community repo](https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/junland/osjs-dev/) 
(you can also find detailed instructions here), or generate one yourself with `./bin/build-docker-image.sh`.

When you have started the image, simply navigate to [http://IP:8000](http://IP:8000) (port 8000 is default).
